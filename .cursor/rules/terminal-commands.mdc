# Cursor Rules for MUG Project

## Terminal Command Restrictions

**NEVER** run the following commands:
- `bun run dev` or any development server commands
- `npm start`, `yarn dev`, or similar development commands
- Any docker command (docker:rebuild, docker:destroy, etc)
- Any commands that start long-running processes or servers
- Only the USER can run the application

## Allowed TypeScript Checking Commands

For the **web project** (packages/web):
- `bun check` - to check TypeScript errors

For **other projects** (packages/game-engine, packages/api, packages/db):
- `tsc --noEmit` - to check TypeScript errors without emitting files

## Example Usage

Check web project:
```bash
cd packages/web && bun check
```

Check game engine:
```bash
cd packages/game-engine && tsc --noEmit
```

Check API:
```bash
cd packages/api && tsc --noEmit
```

Check database:
```bash
cd packages/db && tsc --noEmit
```

## Project Structure Notes

- This is a monorepo with multiple packages
- Each package has its own TypeScript configuration
- Use the appropriate checking command for each package type
- Always verify TypeScript compilation before suggesting changes are complete
